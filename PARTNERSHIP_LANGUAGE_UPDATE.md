## Future Partnership Claims

**Before claiming any organizational partnership:**

3. ✅ Get approval for logo usage in partnership context
4. ✅ Update specification documents with partnership details
5. ✅ Document partnership scope and nature

## Questions or Concerns

If unsure whether to display an organization:
1. Do we have explicit permission? (If NO → Don't display)
2. Is there a formal partnership agreement? (If NO → Use "guest/collaborator" language)
3. Can we clearly describe the relationship? (If NO → Don't display)
